# PlexBoxd

**PlexBoxd** is a Chrome extension that makes it effortless to check if a movie you're browsing on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) is available on any of your Plex servers (via Overseerr) — and lets you request it with a single click if it's not.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Detects when you're viewing a film on Letterboxd
- ⚡ Instantly checks all your configured Overseerr servers
- 🎬 One-click movie requests when content isn’t available
- 🖥️ Works with multiple servers (great for shared libraries)

## 🛠 Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder.
5. Click the extension icon, then **Settings** to add your servers.

### 🧩 Overseerr Server Requirements

To connect a server, you'll need:

- The **URL** of your Overseerr instance (e.g., `https://requestsv2.jorn.co`)
- A valid **API Key**

#### Where to find your API key:
1. Open your Overseerr web interface.
2. Go to **Users** → select your user → **API Key**.
3. Copy the key and paste it into the extension settings.
